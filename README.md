# Endurance-Race-Tool

## Introduction
Endurance-Race-Tool, ERT in short, is what helps you host a race with Assetto Corsa Competizione.

## Features
They're under development, which means you can't use that at this moment.

#### For host: 
* Automatic record arrangement with results from multiple practice sessions
* Automatic team grouping
* Grid and customizable time penalty [^1][^2]
* Broadcastable message [^3]
* Full course yellow flag [^3]
* Safety car [^3]
* Multiple race director [^3]

[^1]: Only available in race sessions.
[^2]: Works by rearranging grid with penalty-added time(from session result data).
[^3]: Third party feature, which means it doesn't use the system in ACC nor force the drivers to follow. Be aware that drivers can always break the rule and do unexpected behavior, like overtaking in FCY. Though, some violations will be reported if detected.

#### For drivers:
* Sound message when events like FCY, or Safety car occurs.
* Voice recognition communication [^4]
* Communication with drivers of same team, including TTS [^4]

[^4]: Third party feature, which means you need to run a program along with ACC.
